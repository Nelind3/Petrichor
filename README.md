Petrichor is a simple, techy, client side only QOL minecraft modpack.

Petrichors aim is a better vanilla (content wise) minecraft client experience especially in the more "techy" areas like NBT handling (note as this pack is still in beta and i found a licensing issue most of the tech related features will have to wait until i implement them myself).  
Petrichor also aims for full optifine resource pack and shader pack parity.

# Feautures
Curently Petrichor supports shaders, (hopefully) full optifine resource pack format parity, minihud hud tweaks and schematics

# Installation
You can install Petrichor using anything that accepts modrinth packs (you can also export it to a curseforge format using packwiz if needed). Personally i use [Prismlauncher](https://prismlauncher.org/).

NOTE! If you want the basic connected textures (glass, sandstone etc) be sure to enable the bundled resourcepack(s) from Continuity
